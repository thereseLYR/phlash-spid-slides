    <h3>Performance Matters</h3>
    <p>How performance scores can affect YOUR app</p>
  </Slide>

  <Slide sectionTitle="Performance Scoring" subSectionTitle="Definition">
    <p>A numerical rating that reflects how quickly, efficiently, and smoothly a website loads and functions for its users.</p>
  </Slide>

  <Slide sectionTitle="Performance Scoring" subSectionTitle="Why it matters">
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Conversion & revenue</li>
      <li class="fragment">User retention & engagement — perceived slowness reduces session length and repeat visits.</li>
      <li class="fragment">Discoverability — search engines and platform tooling increasingly factor performance into ranking and recommendations.</li>
      <li class="fragment">Operational cost — faster pages often mean less CPU/network work on the client and server (lower infra and battery cost).</li>
    </ul>
  </Slide>

  <Slide sectionTitle="Performance Scoring" subSectionTitle="Concrete examples">
    <ul>
      <li class="fragment">Shopping sites reported measurable revenue gains after shaving hundreds of milliseconds from key flows.</li>
      <li class="fragment">Large consumer platforms reported increased engagement after improving load and interactivity.</li>
    </ul>
